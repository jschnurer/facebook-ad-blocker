# Facebook Ad Blocker
This is a Mozilla Firefox extension that tries to block Facebook Ads by checking for new elements on the page every 1 second and removing any that it thinks is a Sponsored post, a Suggested post, or the stupid Reels thing.

It uses quite a bit of CPU because it checks on a timer instead of as a response to new things being put onto the page due to Firefox extension limitations.

# Permissions / Why does this run on all Facebook urls?
So that it can remove the ads from any Facebook page you happen to view.
